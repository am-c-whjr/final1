    <h3>Functioning:</h3>
    <p>1.	A mini data collector can be dispatched in all water bodies which contains a camera as well as probes which measure and record values for dissolved Chlorophyll-A in the region that they are covering.<br> 
2.	Satellite imagery to measure Atmospheric NO2 for regions can be used.
3.	Data collector and Satellite plots will graph values continuously which can be used to analyse data on a much minute scale and understand.<br> changes.<br>
4.	Graphs can be compared (Change in atmospheric NO2 and change in Chlorophyll A).<br>
5.	The data collector is mobile and can hence be used to analyse changes physically as well by providing images of surface algal blooms.<br>
6.	Abnormal/Anomalous plots alert researchers directly.<br>
7.	Immediately issue can be interpreted and tackled.<br></p>
    <h3>Advantages:</h3>
    <p>1.	Data collectors can provide a much in depth analysis compared to satellite images as it can be focusing on a small region which satellites cannot.<br>
2.	Smaller objects much more cost-effective (they don’t have high maintenance, don’t need to be launched---can simply be dropped from a boat and remote controlled).<br>
3.	Aquatic habitats too can be understood (performs the function of measuring environmental changes along with exploratory skills---no additional machinery required).<br>
4.	Navigation and communication by satellite networking (multiple data collectors can be linked to a single satellite mobile in that region, no need to connect to each and every device)<br>
5.	Weather (satellite may be unable to identify situation but MDC can)<br></p>
    <h3>Disadvantages:</h3>
    <p> 
1.	Difficult to retrieve in case probe/any other part not functioning properly.<br>
2.	Due to miniature size, can get stuck in multiple regions such as crevices and can also be ingested.<br>
3.	More manpower needed to monitor multiple devices rather than a single satellite.<br></p>
    <h3>
Why this form of technology over current satellite images?</h3>
    <p>
1.	An insight or a better understanding can sometimes be gained if we look on a smaller scale.<br>
2.	With the MDCs and The App, data is not generalised over a large region such as satellites which may be restricted in terms of predicting temporary changes due to factors such as agriculture, human activity etc. <br>
3.	Regions have non-uniform conditions in terms of nutritional composition which promote or restrict algal growth- regions can be specifically analysed as to what caused to either be favourable for algal bloom or detrimental.<br></p>
